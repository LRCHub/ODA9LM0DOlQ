[00:08.30] This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
[00:16.09] No silent prayer for faith-departed
[00:33.59] 
[00:24.26] And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
[00:27.76] You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
[00:53.26] 
[00:33.44] It's my life
[00:35.81] It's now or never
[00:39.28] But I ain't gonna live forever
[00:43.61] I just want to live while I'm alive
[00:49.32] (It's my life)
[00:51.14] My heart is like an open highway
[00:55.04] Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
[00:59.31] I just want to live while I'm alive
[01:04.36] It's my life
[01:10.36] 
[01:14.18] Yeah, this is for the ones who stood their ground
[01:22.13] For Tommy and Gina, who never backed down
[01:42.63] 
[01:30.26] Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
[01:34.15] Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks
[01:59.15] 
[01:39.39] It's my life
[01:41.62] And it's now or never
[01:45.26] I ain't gonna live forever
[01:49.37] I just want to live while I'm alive
[01:55.55] (It's my life)
[01:57.06] My heart is like an open highway
[02:01.10] Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
[02:05.47] I just want to live while I'm alive
[02:10.14] 'Cause it's my life
[02:19.64] 
[02:28.30] Better stand tall when they're calling you out
[02:32.07] Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
[02:55.07] 
[02:37.55] It's my life
[02:39.62] And it's now or never
[02:43.21] 'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
[02:47.35] I just want to live while I'm alive
[02:53.51] (It's my life)
[02:55.17] My heart is like an open highway
[02:59.21] Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
[03:03.46] I just want to live while I'm alive
[03:20.96] 
[03:08.48] (It's my life)
[03:11.89] And it's now or never
[03:15.57] I ain't gonna live forever
[03:19.50] I just want to live while I'm alive
[03:25.33] (It's my life)
[03:27.11] My heart is like an open highway
[03:31.11] Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
[03:35.58] I just want to live while I'm alive
[03:40.20] 'Cause it's my life
