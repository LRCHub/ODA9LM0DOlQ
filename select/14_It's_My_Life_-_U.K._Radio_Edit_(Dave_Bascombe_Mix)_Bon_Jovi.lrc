[00:07.81] This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
[00:15.76] No silent prayer for the faith-departed
[00:23.99] I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
[00:27.23] You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
[00:52.73] 
[00:32.77] It's my life
[00:34.75] It's now or never
[00:37.10] I ain't gonna live forever
[00:41.63] I just want to live while I'm alive
[00:59.13] 
[00:47.97] (It's my life)
[00:50.47] My heart is like an open highway
[00:53.96] Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
[00:58.56] I just want to live while I'm alive
[01:03.61] It's my life
[01:09.61] 
[01:13.47] This is for the ones who stood their ground
[01:20.74] For Tommy and Gina, who never backed down
[01:29.11] Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
[01:33.38] Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks
[01:58.38] 
[01:39.15] It's my life
[01:40.73] And it's now or never
[01:43.60] I ain't gonna live forever
[01:48.06] I just want to live while I'm alive
[02:05.56] 
[01:53.11] (It's my life)
[01:56.07] My heart is like an open highway
[02:00.02] Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
[02:04.36] I just want to live while I'm alive
[02:09.48] 'Cause it's my life
[02:18.98] 
[02:27.20] Better stand tall when they're calling you out
[02:31.18] Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
[02:54.18] 
[02:36.40] It's my life
[02:38.94] And it's now or never
[02:42.01] 'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
[02:46.51] I just want to live while I'm alive
[03:04.01] 
[02:51.68] (It's my life)
[02:54.31] My heart is like an open highway
[02:56.75] Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
[03:02.36] I just want to live while I'm alive
[03:19.86] 
[03:07.45] (It's my life)
[03:10.15] And it's now or never
[03:13.18] I ain't gonna live forever
[03:17.73] I just want to live while I'm alive
[03:35.23] 
[03:22.72] (It's my life)
[03:25.83] My heart is like an open highway
[03:29.08] Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
[03:33.83] I just want to live while I'm alive
[03:39.11] 'Cause it's my life
