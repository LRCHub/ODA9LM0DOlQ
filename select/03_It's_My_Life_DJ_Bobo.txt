It's my life
I stand it all alone
Accept my way of living
I live it on my own
It's my life
I try to be so free
'Cause freedom is the promise
Of my destiny
It's my life
Oho, ohoho
I'm never gonna give it up
Oho, ohoho
I never ever lose my aim
Oho, ohoho
I'm never gonna give it up
Accept my way of living
It's my life

I am dreaming in the sunshine
I dream of all the people
I talked to in my lifetime
Different cultures, different nations
Happy people, lucky people
Feeling my vibrations

They just told me all the reasons
I have to find my own way
Don't change it like the season
It's my life, I live it on my own
Welcome to the dangerzone

Like my mother is holding my hand
Whenever I'm alone
Music is my best friend
You're my passion, we're together
Music is my life
I want to live with you forever

There's no limit, celebration
Everybody come on and dance
Feel the fascination
Like a Rolling Stone into the microphone
I live it on my own

I am dreaming in the sunshine
I dream of all the people
I talked to in my lifetime
Different cultures, different nations
Happy people, lucky people
Feeling my vibrations
